#UNTETHERED

Empowering Global Volunteers through Blockchain Technology

Project Overview
UNTETHERED is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to empower volunteers globally by leveraging the Ethereum blockchain. Our platform enables volunteers to raise concerns, participate in problem-solving, and receive Ethereum tokens as incentives for their contributions. By aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), UNTETHERED fosters a community-driven approach to addressing global challenges.

Problem Statement
Volunteering is a critical component in addressing global issues, yet many volunteers face challenges such as:

Lack of Recognition: Volunteers often do not receive adequate acknowledgment for their efforts.
Resource Allocation: Inefficient distribution of resources and incentives can demotivate volunteers.
Transparency: Limited transparency in how volunteer contributions impact projects and communities.
Engagement: Difficulty in maintaining volunteer engagement and participation over time.

Solution
UNTETHERED addresses these challenges by providing a transparent, incentivized platform that:

Recognizes Contributions: Volunteers earn Ethereum tokens for their participation, offering tangible rewards.
Ensures Transparency: Blockchain technology ensures all transactions and contributions are transparent and immutable.
Facilitates Resource Allocation: Smart contracts manage the distribution of resources based on volunteer contributions.
Enhances Engagement: Gamification and token incentives encourage sustained volunteer participation.

Features

Decentralized Governance: Volunteers can propose and vote on initiatives, ensuring community-driven decision-making.
Token Rewards: Earn Ethereum tokens for solving issues and contributing to projects aligned with the UN SDGs.
Transparent Tracking: All contributions and rewards are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with React for an intuitive and seamless user experience.
Scalable Solutions: Utilizes Layer 2 solutions to ensure scalability and reduce transaction costs.

Technology Stack
Frontend: React
Blockchain Platform: Ethereum with Layer 2 Solutions
